RULE 1: NO FAKES. NEVER.
- No UI surfaces without real backend logic.
- No empty function bodies.
- No TODO comments indicating missing core logic.
- No mock data arrays.
- No disabled inputs that are "wired later".
- No throw new Error('TODO...') in any shipped function.
- If a backend cannot be implemented right now, do not build the UI for it.
- All logic must be registered in DCM.yaml before implementation.
- Every visual element that renders data must have advl_meta linking it to a real DCM use case.
- Every store action must call a real service or platform method — no placeholders.

This applies to every file, every session, without exception.
Violation = code is deleted, not fixed with another stub.
